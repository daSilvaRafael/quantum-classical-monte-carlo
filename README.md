# Quantum-classical Monte Carlo

This Jupyter notebook contains the code used to assess the feasibility and potential utility of a discretization-informed method for quantum-classical Monte Carlo algorithms. The accuracy of the Maximum Likelihood Quantum Amplitude Estimation (MLQAE) algorithm, classical emulated (quantum simulator), is calculated with respect to the Black-Scholes formula and classical Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for pricing European call options when dividend yield is unknown.
