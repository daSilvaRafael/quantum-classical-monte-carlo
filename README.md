# Hybrid quantum-classical Monte Carlo

 This jupyter notebook contains the code used to assess the feasibility and potential utility of hybrid quantum-classical Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms. The accuracy of the Maximum Likelihood Quantum Amplitude Estimation (MLQAE) algorithm, classical emulated (quantum simulator), is compared against classical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the Black-Scholes formula for pricing European call options when dividends are unknown.
